/* Tailwind's form plugin adds a down arrow to selects using a background image.
 * Vue-good-table css also adds its own down arrow, leading to duplicate arrows.
 * This disables tailwind's down arrow to fix it.
 * I would've liked to keep this local to the vue component, but it wasn't being
 * applied, so had to put it globally.
