## Structure

* Specs: Since LTI has been split up into multiple specs for different functions, we can roughly structure the code by spec. For each spec, we can further divide them into Platform and Tool side functionalities.
  * Launch: [LTI 1.3 Core Spec](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/v1p3/)
  * Security: [IMS Security Framework](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p0)
  * Nrps: [Names and Role Provisioning Services](http://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti-nrps/v2p0)
